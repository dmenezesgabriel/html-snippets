      <h1>The Internet</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p>A set of computers interconnected around the world which use a set of services and protocols in comum to allow
        communication.</p>
      <p>The internet was invented 1960, during the cold war, when the EUA developed a computer network to descentralize
        information and make it redundant, in case one of it's information center was attacked, the informations would
        not be lost and and the communication would be maintained.</p>
      <p>Between 1960 and 1970 the academy created a network that integrated american universities, where researchers
        and students could exchange information and discoveries.</p>
      <p>In 1990 Tim Berners Lee created the www(World wide web) what made possible the use of graphical interfaces and
        the creation of sites with the HTML language.</p>
      <p>To access the internet is necessary to use of a Browser and type the site's url, in that way a message will be
        sent to the server in which the site is deployed, then it will process the message and send it back the page
        informations to the user. With this informations, the browser is capable to display the site.</p>
      <p>How we can access this informations from distant parts of the world? With <b>Backbones</b>, they are the
        internet highways.</p>
      <p>The backbones of different continents are connected by submarine cables which crosses seas and oceans to
        interconnect the world.</p>
      <p>
        The communication between the networks spread around the world is possible due to the use of protocols known as
        <b>TCP/IP</b> protocol suite, created at 1975 by Arpanet.
